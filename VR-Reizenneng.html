                Did you always wanted to travel, but had fear to leave the house?
                Than we are here to offer you some documentaries you can follow from your home.
                You will probably ask yourself how you can follow a trip from your home .
                We are doing this by using virtual reality (VR). <br> <br>

                What is virtual reality?
                <br> Virtual reality is a virtual reality, it is not real.
                To join this virtual reality you have to put on a vr-headset. This can be as simple as a homemade cardbox VR-headset.
                You can buy a very expensive VR-headset, for this journey you will have enough with a cardbox one. <br> <br>

                I do not have a VR-headset, what now?
                <br> If you do not have a VR-headset, do not worry.
                You can follow the documentaries without a VR-headset.
                We have to admit that watching the documentaries without VR glasses is a less intense experience than with VR glasses.
                We will have to admit that the experience different is without a VR-headset.
                It is not as intense.
                You will not be able to look around you.
                You will not have the possibility to look around.
                But think about it, a VR-headset will not have to be expensive.  <br> <br>
